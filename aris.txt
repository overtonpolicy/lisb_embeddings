How can governance and standards frameworks encourage greater inclusion and security across the ecosystem? What would a good framework for measuring inclusion in digital identity markets look like? How can we minimise security and privacy risks within digital identity solutions? In order to ensure the UK is well protected now and in the future we need to build upon our existing knowledge of cyber security risks and the resilience of software supply chains and are working to identify which mitigations the government can leverage to ensure the UK is well protected now and in the future.\n\nWe’re also assessing the impact of these mitigations in driving enhanced security measures. A key area of research interest therefore is understanding the consequences of requiring higher levels of cybersecurity for products and digital services sold in the UK. Strengthening this evidence base will help shape and inform future policy work around the regulation of products and business requirements for cyber security. \nSome technologies are critical to cyberspace. To build and sustain competitive edge in cyber-related technologies we need a coordinated, rigorous and consistent approach to identify and analyse critical areas of science and technology and prioritise national effort.

Evidence and data on the climate impact of life sciences activity. The analysis team is responsible for two datasets on life sciences activity in the UK and how it compares with other countries. One of its publications, the Bioscience and health technology sector statistics, is an official statistic and captures a detailed breakdown of where life sciences activity occurs in the UK, as well as key economic indicators such as employment and turnover. The analysis team is also responsible for publishing the Life sciences competitiveness indicators, a publication which tracks UK performance against international comparators. These two publications form the bulk of the evidence base that supports OLS policy making and key facts and figures for stakeholders. One of the ambitions of the team is to expand the range of data collected on activity in the sector to encompass a broader range of economic indicators, including Gross Value Added, R&amp;D spending, Wages, and workforce statistics, among others.\n\nIn addition to this critical evidence base, OLS is also interested in key research questions and evidence to support the development of policy for the Life Sciences Missions, a set of disease and intervention areas identified in the Life Sciences Vision as key areas of intervention to help the NHS to solve some of the biggest healthcare problems of our generation. These range from establishing a strong evidence base on incidence and its regional distribution to identifying potential innovative technologies that could address them. Additionally, the analysis team is also very interested in deepening our understanding of the economic impact and possibilities of the broad area of genomics, as well as understanding the economic impacts and societal benefits that accrue from conducting clinical trials and other forms of R&amp;D in the life sciences.\n\nOn the regulatory front, OLS would like to expand its understanding of the main regulatory barriers to the approval and roll-out of new, innovative technologies, as well as understanding the costs and benefits associated with these regulations. We have a limited evidence base for some products but would like to expand that understanding to be better able to assess the impact of specific regulatory interventions. We would also like to have more comprehensive data on the introduction and adoption of these technologies across the country and through the NHS.\n\nOn the investment front, we are particularly interested in building a more comprehensive evidence base on the determinants of investment in both manufacturing and R&amp;D facilities, and how elements of both the commercial and business environment affects company location and investment decisions.\n\nFinally, we are very interested in developing a more comprehensive understanding of the manufacturing landscape in the UK, from being able to interrogate the pipeline of new products and innovations in development, to establishing the UK’s manufacturing capabilities for health and supply chain resilience, as well as understanding key challenges faced by companies in terms of access to skilled workers and finance across the country.

One of its publications, the Bioscience and health technology sector statistics, is an official statistic and captures a detailed breakdown of where life sciences activity occurs in the UK, as well as key economic indicators such as employment and turnover. The analysis team is also responsible for publishing the Life sciences competitiveness indicators, a publication which tracks UK performance against international comparators. These two publications form the bulk of the evidence base that supports OLS policy making and key facts and figures for stakeholders. One of the ambitions of the team is to expand the range of data collected on activity in the sector to encompass a broader range of economic indicators, including Gross Value Added, R&amp;D spending, Wages, and workforce statistics, among others.\n\nIn addition to this critical evidence base, OLS is also interested in key research questions and evidence to support the development of policy for the Life Sciences Missions, a set of disease and intervention areas identified in the Life Sciences Vision as key areas of intervention to help the NHS to solve some of the biggest healthcare problems of our generation. These range from establishing a strong evidence base on incidence and its regional distribution to identifying potential innovative technologies that could address them. Additionally, the analysis team is also very interested in deepening our understanding of the economic impact and possibilities of the broad area of genomics, as well as understanding the economic impacts and societal benefits that accrue from conducting clinical trials and other forms of R&amp;D in the life sciences.\n\nOn the regulatory front, OLS would like to expand its understanding of the main regulatory barriers to the approval and roll-out of new, innovative technologies, as well as understanding the costs and benefits associated with these regulations. We have a limited evidence base for some products but would like to expand that understanding to be better able to assess the impact of specific regulatory interventions. We would also like to have more comprehensive data on the introduction and adoption of these technologies across the country and through the NHS.\n\nOn the investment front, we are particularly interested in building a more comprehensive evidence base on the determinants of investment in both manufacturing and R&amp;D facilities, and how elements of both the commercial and business environment affects company location and investment decisions.\n\nFinally, we are very interested in developing a more comprehensive understanding of the manufacturing landscape in the UK, from being able to interrogate the pipeline of new products and innovations in development, to establishing the UK’s manufacturing capabilities for health and supply chain resilience, as well as understanding key challenges faced by companies in terms of access to skilled workers and finance across the country."
What are the best front and back-end management practices and how do they influence project performance? Our purpose is to continuously improve the way infrastructure and major projects are delivered, in order to support government priorities and improve people’s lives. We aspire to create the best performing project system of any country in the world. We measure how well the system is performing, so we can learn important lessons and continuously improve project performance over time.

Which risks from AI are the most urgent to mitigate? In the National AI Strategy, the government made commitments to enrich our understanding of AI as it impacts the economy and society more broadly. Additionally, we recently launched a steering board chaired by the heads of both the government analysis and scientific functions, to ensure cohesive cross government approaches to understanding AI impacts. An overview of the high-level questions we are asking in this regard are outlined in the section below. (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-aistrategy) \n\nSome priority work we are currently developing to meet these commitments include: \n\nAn analysis of the AI White Paper consultation to feed into the formal consultation response. This will allow us to take on feedback from the public and various key players in sectors across the economy, and better tailor policy interventions to support strategic AI aims. \n\nEstablishing the AI Safety Institute to advance the world’s knowledge of AI safety by carefully examining, evaluating, and testing new frontier AI systems. The Institute will conduct fundamental research on how to keep people safe in the face of fast and unpredictable progress in AI, improving our understanding of the capabilities and risks of AI systems.\n\nA monitoring and evaluation framework for AI regulatory interventions in tandem with the AI regulatory white paper. This will develop our understanding of key metrics to monitor with regards to Ai governance and ecosystem impacts. \n\nResearch into the AI sector and supply. Updating the AI Sector Study to establish a consistent and comparable set of economic indicators for the AI sector in terms of producers and suppliers. This study helps us to best understand where the AI sector needs support, to grow sovereign capability of the UK in AI, in alignment with strategic priorities. \n\nThe development of a cross-economy national AI risk register. Developed in tandem with a responsibility register that garnered cross Whitehall agreement on which departments hold which risks with regards to AI. The risk register will provide a single source of truth on AI risks which regulators, government departments, and external groups can use to prioritise further action.\n\nFurther research into Compute and the best ways to leverage compute to support the AI sector. This will be key to informing our response to the future of compute review, and maximising the £1 billion+ investments in state-of-the-art compute.

What are the possible scenarios for various AI risks 1, 3, 5, 10 and more years from now? In the National AI Strategy, the government made commitments to enrich our understanding of AI as it impacts the economy and society more broadly. Additionally, we recently launched a steering board chaired by the heads of both the government analysis and scientific functions, to ensure cohesive cross government approaches to understanding AI impacts. An overview of the high-level questions we are asking in this regard are outlined in the section below. (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/national-aistrategy) \n\nSome priority work we are currently developing to meet these commitments include: \n\nAn analysis of the AI White Paper consultation to feed into the formal consultation response. This will allow us to take on feedback from the public and various key players in sectors across the economy, and better tailor policy interventions to support strategic AI aims. \n\nEstablishing the AI Safety Institute to advance the world’s knowledge of AI safety by carefully examining, evaluating, and testing new frontier AI systems. The Institute will conduct fundamental research on how to keep people safe in the face of fast and unpredictable progress in AI, improving our understanding of the capabilities and risks of AI systems.\n\nA monitoring and evaluation framework for AI regulatory interventions in tandem with the AI regulatory white paper. This will develop our understanding of key metrics to monitor with regards to Ai governance and ecosystem impacts. \n\nResearch into the AI sector and supply. Updating the AI Sector Study to establish a consistent and comparable set of economic indicators for the AI sector in terms of producers and suppliers. This study helps us to best understand where the AI sector needs support, to grow sovereign capability of the UK in AI, in alignment with strategic priorities. \n\nThe development of a cross-economy national AI risk register. Developed in tandem with a responsibility register that garnered cross Whitehall agreement on which departments hold which risks with regards to AI. The risk register will provide a single source of truth on AI risks which regulators, government departments, and external groups can use to prioritise further action.\n\nFurther research into Compute and the best ways to leverage compute to support the AI sector. This will be key to informing our response to the future of compute review, and maximising the £1 billion+ investments in state-of-the-art compute.

How can we best support children and young people with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) and those who attend Alternative Provision (AP)? A sizeable minority of children and young people in England face a significant range of vulnerabilities and disadvantages. These include those already known to children’s social care, children in need, those eligible for free school meals (FSM) because of low family income, those with SEND, in particular those who have an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plans and those who attend Alternative Provision. Given the human, economic and social cost of poor performance in this area, we are seeking evidence on the best ways to improve outcomes for these children and young people, before issues become acute and require more significant intervention

What are the big strategic questions in relation to ‘Pro-Innovation Regulation’ that the government should be focused on?  Do regulatory mandates and remits need to change and if so how, as markets and the economy continue to shift?  Is sector-focused regulation struggling to cope with changing markets, and how should it interact with horizontal regulation?  Should innovation be made an explicit part of regulators’ remit, without diluting their responsibility for consumer safety?  How far should regulation be used to create new markets or shape existing ones? "Technology Strategy\n\nAs the team has a broad remit, there are a range of different areas of evidence needs. These are likely to be areas of ongoing enquiry, as we seek to keep abreast of market and technological developments. We are also interested in the interaction of these issues e.g. with systems approaches. \n\n\nEvidence challenges\nOne of the main challenges we have is that SIC codes do not readily permit us to do analysis of technology sectors, so we need to use specialist datasets, bespoke studies or natural language processing to enable us to collect data on the issues.\n\nWe work with technology experts to define classifying methods.\n\nHow evidence is used\nWe already have databases on business activity and equity funding in the team, with access to other datasets across the Department on research activity, exports, skills, patents, IP, etc. We are nevertheless always interested in hearing about new data developments in this space.\n\nWe also have evidence from commissioned studies, and call for evidence responses.\n"

R&D Tax Credits: What impact will tax credit changes have in attracting private R&D investment? SRID evidence aims to ensure that DSIT’s significant RDI budget is invested effectively and that we understand its impact and value for money. The Science, Technology and Innovation Analysis Team (STIA), the analytical team supporting SRID, develop the evidence base via internal analysis, cross-Whitehall collaboration and externally commissioned research projects. STIA work closely with other analytical teams in DSIT and DSIT’s partner organisations.\n\nSTIA continuously work to improve our approach and methods of valuing RDI investment to fully showcase and evidence its value to the UK. We are also interested in developing new real-time performance monitoring tools to allow for more agile decision-making and significantly improve our Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) capabilities. Improving our methodology for measuring economic, social and research benefits of RDI is also our priority.\n\nSRID and STIA want to develop a stronger evidence base of the foundations of the Research Development and Innovation (RDI) system including how to: 1) grow the RDI workforce by improving the domestic pipeline, attracting and retaining the most talented RDI workers and supporting diverse, dynamic and creative careers 2) develop strong and sustainable RDI institutions that foster innovation 3) identify and capitalise on RDI clusters in the UK to support the levelling up agenda.  \nWe also aim to develop a better understanding of how RDI policy can best drive economic growth, better jobs and discoveries. We aim to do this through identifying the best methods for measuring adoption and diffusion of innovation as well as drivers and barriers to innovation to create conditions for an increased investment in innovation. \n\nTracking trends and patterns in RDI helps to ensure that the Department stays up to date with key indicators of UK’s performance and its competitiveness in the global landscape of Science and Technology.

We are primarily interested in the UK regulatory system as a whole.  But we are interested in regulation / standards in relation to particular technologies / sectors as well, particularly where it reveals more generalisable insights.\n•\tTakes a very broad view of the definition of innovation.  We are involved in very early-stage technologies (like quantum computing and fusion energy production) through to technologies which are already reaching markets (like drones and neurotechnology).\n•\tRecognises the diversity of organisations that are involved in innovation – including academic researchers, start-ups, scale ups and established large firms.\n•\tRecognises that regulatory opportunities and challenges are not unique to the UK.  We are therefore open to learning from international experiences and examples of good practice.\n•\tIs primarily interested in the role of regulation / standards in supporting innovation.  But we are also interested in how regulators / standards bodies can use data / technology to support their work (e.g. in making the regulatory environment easier to navigate or enabling more effective risk-based compliance).\nEvidence challenges\nWe are interested in all kinds of evidence (qualitative or quantitative) which are relevant to our research questions.  But we recognise that it can be challenging to generate quantitative evidence in our policy area:\n•\tIt often doesn’t lend itself to experimental methods. Because regulation is a system-level intervention, opportunities to use Randomised Control Trials are limited.  \n•\tLarge-sample survey methods have been used in the past (e.g. UK Innovation Survey) to understand innovators perceptions but these have limited coverage of emerging technologies.  \n•\tMeasuring the impact of government policies is also challenging because of the long time - horizons involved and the difficulties in separating the impacts of regulation from other policies (e.g. investment, skills).  \n\nAs such, much of the existing research in this field is qualitative (case studies, in-depth interviews) and evaluation is typically theory-based.  \n"

How can we address barriers to action on adaptation, including behavioural change, and how can government policy best encourage these changes? Adaptation and resilience: Defra is the lead government department for climate adaptation, responsible for the assessment of appropriate action to protect and enhance natural and human systems in a changing climate. Also, for increasing resilience and mitigating against risk. Such assessment is used in many areas, including for the statutory requirement of the Climate Change Act to produce a 5-yearly, “Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) and National Adaptation Programme (NAP)”.\n\nAlthough Defra has overarching responsibility for producing the CCRA and is responsible for managing several climate risks (such as impact on the natural environment), a number of climate risks (such as the impact on transport, health, business) are the responsibility of other government departments (for example Department for Transport (DfT), Department for Health (DfH), Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG).

How can we develop and exploit new methodologies to ensure cost-effective monitoring of climate change and adaptation actions and impact on climate risk? How do we measure resilience to test the success and cost effectiveness of actions, and incorporate resilience indicators into decision making? Adaptation and resilience: Defra is the lead government department for climate adaptation, responsible for the assessment of appropriate action to protect and enhance natural and human systems in a changing climate. Also, for increasing resilience and mitigating against risk. Such assessment is used in many areas, including for the statutory requirement of the Climate Change Act to produce a 5-yearly, “Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) and National Adaptation Programme (NAP)”.\n\nAlthough Defra has overarching responsibility for producing the CCRA and is responsible for managing several climate risks (such as impact on the natural environment), a number of climate risks (such as the impact on transport, health, business) are the responsibility of other government departments (for example Department for Transport (DfT), Department for Health (DfH), Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG).

Climate projections (for example UK Climate Projections 18) indicate increased climate variability and extreme events (storms, heat waves, drought) in the future. How will these changes impact natural and human systems? How can we protect against damage caused by such increased variability? Adaptation and resilience: Defra is the lead government department for climate adaptation, responsible for the assessment of appropriate action to protect and enhance natural and human systems in a changing climate. Also, for increasing resilience and mitigating against risk. Such assessment is used in many areas, including for the statutory requirement of the Climate Change Act to produce a 5-yearly, “Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) and National Adaptation Programme (NAP)”.\n\nAlthough Defra has overarching responsibility for producing the CCRA and is responsible for managing several climate risks (such as impact on the natural environment), a number of climate risks (such as the impact on transport, health, business) are the responsibility of other government departments (for example Department for Transport (DfT), Department for Health (DfH), Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG).

To that end, our areas of research interest focus on better understanding the challenges and opportunities in the delivery of public services in the future, including the demand for the public services, making more effective use of data, reducing ethnic disparities and being more diverse and inclusive, and the level of productivity in the public sector.
What criteria should we use to determine acceptable sectoral climate resilience scenarios across government departments, and when building preparedness externally? Adaptation and resilience: Defra is the lead government department for climate adaptation, responsible for the assessment of appropriate action to protect and enhance natural and human systems in a changing climate. Also, for increasing resilience and mitigating against risk. Such assessment is used in many areas, including for the statutory requirement of the Climate Change Act to produce a 5-yearly, “Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) and National Adaptation Programme (NAP)”.\n\nAlthough Defra has overarching responsibility for producing the CCRA and is responsible for managing several climate risks (such as impact on the natural environment), a number of climate risks (such as the impact on transport, health, business) are the responsibility of other government departments (for example Department for Transport (DfT), Department for Health (DfH), Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG).

What knowledge and skills do all teachers and school leaders need to support pupils with SEND? How should this differ throughout the stages of a teacher’s career? Our goal is to create a world-class school system that ensures every child is taught a broad and ambitious knowledge-rich curriculum by highly skilled teachers, so they can achieve their potential. We need to continue to develop the evidence base around effective teaching practice and curriculum design, with teaching increasingly viewed as an applied science (akin to medicine) where evidence-based approaches are widely utilised, and skilled teachers draw upon expert support and professional communities. We also need to build our understanding of how best to replicate the success of high performing schools, and how school trusts can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their schools, including through management of the school estate. A key part of this is building evidence on the most successful school approaches to improving attendance.

ARI 1: early action to prevent poor health outcomes\n\nResearch objective: Research to understand and deliver prevention, timely diagnosis and appropriate intervention for people at increased risk of poor health (in particular obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, mental health and cancer) to prevent excess deaths, improve population health (including the health of the working age population), reduce disparities and reduce reliance on health and social care.\n\nPriority research topics: Developing, evaluating and understanding how to implement interventions which prevent health problems developing, accurately identify those at risk, effectively manage risk factors and treat conditions early, and manage health problems to prevent severe disease in the 4 areas set out below.\n\n- Prevent: Interventions to prevent health problems, developing effective routes to reach those who are most at risk or marginalised, and understanding how to effectively implement proven interventions at scale (for example, antihypertensives, mental health programmes for children and young people, vaccines for cancer or workplace preventative interventions).\n\n- Identify: New ways of identifying those most at risk (for example, predictive analysis of GP records to identify those who would benefit from early intervention, new methods of cancer screening and new approaches to diagnosing the causes of chest pains).\n\n- Treat: Interventions early in the course of disease progression (for example, social prescribing, early intervention for cancer or interventions to enable people to remain in or return to work).\n\n- Manage: Interventions to improve the management of multiple long-term conditions (for example, how to manage side effects in polypharmacy), prevent acute events (such as heart attacks, strokes and mental health crises) and ensure effective rehabilitation after these events to reduce long-term illness and disability. Suboptimal management of risk factors for common diseases (including hypertension, poor metabolic control, late detection of cancers and poor mental health):\n\n- drives morbidity and mortality\n- reduces the proportion of the population able to work and impacts healthcare delivery within the NHS and social care systems\n\nCardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes and many cancers are increasing in prevalence in the UK. For example, there were 5.8% more cancer diagnoses in 2019 compared to 2017 and diagnosed diabetes has increased from 2% of the population in 1994 to 7% in 2019, including sharp increases in those aged under 40 years. Mental health problems spiked during the pandemic, and in children and young people remain above pre-pandemic levels. Among 17 to 19 year olds, the proportion with a probable mental disorder increased from 17.4% in 2021 to 25.7% in 2022.\n\nThe costs to the individual, the health and care system and the economy is large. In 2022, around 2.5 million people in the UK were economically inactive due to ill health, an increase of 688,000 since 2019. Cardiovascular disease costs the UK economy £15.8 billion a year and the NHS £7.4 billion, while the NHS spent over £10 billion on diabetes care in 2019, with one in 6 hospital beds occupied by someone with diabetes.\n\nResearch is needed into how best to prevent disease, ensure timely diagnosis and develop appropriate interventions to prevent acute events and chronic disease. This could significantly improve health and economic outcomes for individuals, support a healthy workforce and reduce pressure on the NHS and social care. For example, preventative interventions and early diagnosis are estimated to reduce strokes, heart attacks and dementia cases by 150,000 over 10 years, saving £2.3 for every £1 spent. In England, more than 90% of people survive bowel, breast and ovarian cancer for at least 5 years if diagnosed at the earliest stage, and Cancer Research UK estimates the cost of treating late-stage colon, rectal, lung and ovarian cancer is nearly two and a half times the amount for early-stage treatment (PDF, 1.35MB). In England, early interventions for mental health problems can reduce hospital admissions, shorten hospital stays and require fewer high-cost intensive interventions potentially saving up to £38 million per year.

Test and evaluation – What are the opportunities to reduce the cost and environmental impacts associated with the test and evaluation of large scale, integrated and complex military systems? Defence spends around £8 billion annually on the provision of equipment and technological solutions for our Armed Forces. The cost of delivering and maintaining these platforms grows with technical complexity. For military platforms and weapons systems, there are significant technical challenges in driving down the cost of integration and ownership; integrating these systems into a networked environment; addressing a range of difficult targets; and providing the ability to defeat targets under highly constrained rules of engagement. This will drive the need for increased stand-off ranges of our platform and weapons systems which will require developments in our propulsion and airframe designs.

What is the impact of chemical hazards (including nanomaterials and microplastics) in food and how can we reduce it? At the heart of our role is the need to ensure food is safe and what it says it is, and in doing so protect consumers from risks within the food system and ensure high food standards. Core to this is a risk analysis process which relies on independent, science-led risk assessment and socio-economic analytical evidence, to support effective risk management decisions. To assure food safety and standards, we must also recognise that the UK is part of an international food supply chain, where we only produce around 50% of all the food we eat in the UK. Our exit from the EU and push for wider international trade has further highlighted how we need to understand the role of trade and international differences in production systems and food standards.

What role does consumer and Food Business Operator behaviour and perception play in ensuring food safety and standards? The FSA’s mission is focused on protecting consumers and acting in the consumer’s interest. It is therefore essential to understand what influences and drives behaviours across the food system. To act in the consumer interest within food policy and the food system, we must understand and monitor behaviours, changing attitudes and consumer-driven trends, and play our part in supporting safe, healthy, sustainable diet choices for all.\n\nTo implement effective policies, we need to understand what consumers think, feel, and do, and how these are changing, as well the differences between consumers, and how these impact on food security, food safety and public health.\n\nUnderstanding the role of new and emerging markets and business models, and through these, the role food businesses play in driving behaviour and influencing consumer demand, is essential. This includes the development and introduction of novel foods (such as alternative protein sources or genetically engineered foods). 
What are the risks and opportunities presented by shifts and disruptions in the food system, including new and emerging technologies, and how should we regulate food in the future?  The 21st Century food system is characterised by its complexity and innovation. The emergence of Covid-19 and the subsequent pandemic put immense strain on the global food system and tested its resilience. It highlighted that, in this interconnected and fast-moving world, we need access to the best data, intelligence and horizon scanning to understand changes in the system, the impact of these, and how they create vulnerabilities.  \n\nGlobal events, new consumer trends, changing business practices, and food innovation can all create new risks and opportunities. In this area, we need research and evidence to understand the potential for disruption in our food system and the impact of change. We need to be able to identify new and emerging food technologies and be prepared for the possible safety and other challenges arising from these novel foods and processes. This includes having an innovative, science-driven risk analysis process in place for regulated products. 
How can the FSA continue to be an innovative and effective regulator when developing and implementing food regulations? The 21st Century food system is characterised by its complexity and innovation. The emergence of Covid-19 and the subsequent pandemic put immense strain on the global food system and tested its resilience. It highlighted that, in this interconnected and fast-moving world, we need access to the best data, intelligence and horizon scanning to understand changes in the system, the impact of these, and how they create vulnerabilities.  \n\nGlobal events, new consumer trends, changing business practices, and food innovation can all create new risks and opportunities.

This includes having an innovative, science-driven risk analysis process in place for regulated products. 
What impact do food insecurity and other disparities have on the consumer and the food system? The FSA’s mission is focused on protecting consumers and acting in the consumer’s interest. It is therefore essential to understand what influences and drives behaviours across the food system. To act in the consumer interest within food policy and the food system, we must understand and monitor behaviours, changing attitudes and consumer-driven trends, and play our part in supporting safe, healthy, sustainable diet choices for all.\n\nTo implement effective policies, we need to understand what consumers think, feel, and do, and how these are changing, as well the differences between consumers, and how these impact on food security, food safety and public health.\n\nUnderstanding the role of new and emerging markets and business models, and through these, the role food businesses play in driving behaviour and influencing consumer demand, is essential. This includes the development and introduction of novel foods (such as alternative protein sources or genetically engineered foods). 
What should be the role of communities in the local devolution agenda? What does the evidence suggest works? Does community involvement in public service delivery at the local tier increase efficiency or effectiveness in achieving public value outcomes? Including bringing together further evidence on what the social and economic impact of having a more integrated and cohesive place is.
How can we support the necessary transition to more healthy and sustainable diets, and what will be the impact on the UK food system, including food security, safety and standards? The food system does not stand in isolation from global challenges such as climate change, plastic pollution and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). We are also facing major health challenges, including an obesity crisis, due to poor diet and nutrition.\n\nWe need to understand how these impact on the food system, either directly or as the result of mitigations/solutions being introduced and the role our science can play to help address these major threats.  As an evidence provider, we will support cross-government initiatives, such as the UK AMR National Action Plan and Net Zero Strategy.

Determining intent – In complex environments involving a range of military and civilian actors, from a variety of cultural backgrounds, we need to be able to determine the intent of adversaries from posture, movement, emissions and stance prior to overt aggressive action. Fifty years ago, major technological developments were primarily driven by the space race and the Cold War. Today, almost all technology development, derived from current global S&amp;T investment, is driven by the consumer market. Advanced technology development, once the realm of government laboratories, is now carried out to a large extent in the civil and commercial sectors. As technology continues to be driven by market needs, exploitation of technology to meet defence and security needs will require an increasing focus and understanding of emerging technologies and their opportunities and impacts on the future of Defence and Security. As well as increased understanding of the evolving physical and social environments in which Defence operates.
Sensors – The basic human need to know and understand your environment is of particular imperative to the Armed Forces. Defence is interested in the development of small, low-power, light-weight, multi-modal sensing capabilities for example to detect explosive and chemical substances, and radio frequency emissions. Fifty years ago, major technological developments were primarily driven by the space race and the Cold War. Today, almost all technology development, derived from current global S&amp;T investment, is driven by the consumer market. Advanced technology development, once the realm of government laboratories, is now carried out to a large extent in the civil and commercial sectors. As technology continues to be driven by market needs, exploitation of technology to meet defence and security needs will require an increasing focus and understanding of emerging technologies and their opportunities and impacts on the future of Defence and Security. As well as increased understanding of the evolving physical and social environments in which Defence operates.
Understanding implication of future technology - Our service personnel and systems will be threatened by the availability of a greater number of devices with diverse sensing modalities, weapon systems with longer range, enhanced lethality and an adversary who could deploy them in ways that exploit our vulnerabilities. Our ability to objectively assess threats from technological advances in areas such as cyber, unmanned systems and additive manufacturing, and quantify their consequences is key to our understanding of future risk. Fifty years ago, major technological developments were primarily driven by the space race and the Cold War.

As well as increased understanding of the evolving physical and social environments in which Defence operates.
Materials and structures – Understanding material selection and performance, ageing, shock and impact resistance, corrosion, design and lifeing aimed towards reducing the long term cost of military equipment across a range of platforms, weapons and application areas. How do we pull through promising materials quickly and at low enough cost to enable early adoption? As commercial investment introduces widely available and low cost systems, the technological lead of the UK and its allies over adversaries is likely to be further eroded, with the democratisation of technologies such as additive manufacturing, cyber and unmanned systems enabling non-government actors to strike at the UK. To counter these advances we need to explore technologies which will improve the survivability of our people and platforms, extended their endurance, and ensure robust and resilient military capabilities.
Exploiting the electromagnetic spectrum - How do we develop approaches to maximise the use of the electronic spectrum in congested environments to ensure commanders are able to access the information they need? How can we improve secure transmission of information? How do we integrate new and emerging technological solutions with legacy equipment to achieve this communications edge? As commercial investment introduces widely available and low cost systems, the technological lead of the UK and its allies over adversaries is likely to be further eroded, with the democratisation of technologies such as additive manufacturing, cyber and unmanned systems enabling non-government actors to strike at the UK. To counter these advances we need to explore technologies which will improve the survivability of our people and platforms, extended their endurance, and ensure robust and resilient military capabilities.
Energy and power – Defence is interested in understanding how advances in energy generation and storage and smart materials may promote more efficient energy consumption, reduce logistic footprint, soldier burden and support high power future sensing and weapons systems. As commercial investment introduces widely available and low cost systems, the technological lead of the UK and its allies over adversaries is likely to be further eroded, with the democratisation of technologies such as additive manufacturing, cyber and unmanned systems enabling non-government actors to strike at the UK. To counter these advances we need to explore technologies which will improve the survivability of our people and platforms, extended their endurance, and ensure robust and resilient military capabilities.
Autonomous systems – What are the ways Defence could exploit autonomy and autonomous systems in military operations and potentially at lower cost than traditional high-end military platforms? What is the range of potential benefits of utilising autonomous systems in Defence; greater areas covered, persistent effects, or removing personnel from immediate danger? How can we reduce the need for human involvement in difficult, mundane and dangerous tasks such as bomb disposal, force protection or decontamination? In an increasingly connected and complex world, we need to optimise our use of rich and diverse data sets to inform decision makers in a timely manner. As the types and volumes of information available to the commander increase, this will place a greater importance on tools and techniques to collate, synthesise and visualise information in a timely and understandable way so that it can be readily acted upon. Different sources will have different degrees of assurance but combining multiple information sources greatly increases the robustness of the analysis – although we need to be able to show levels of certainty/uncertainty within the analysis.
Future skills - We assess that the world of tomorrow will be increasingly automated. How could we determine the different blend of skills needed by Defence in the future? With other sectors competing for the skilled labour, how could Defence ensure it can attract an agile workforce with the required skills? Defence of the UK is critically reliant on access to an appropriately skilled and trained workforce. Demographic changes in the UK, combined with a range of technology advances are likely to change the role of the human in future military tasks – this will demand new skills and different ways of attracting people to join the Defence Enterprise.
Affordable space – How can Defence achieve affordable access to space? How can we harness advances in the commercial sector and maximise our use of space based services? How do we improve our situation awareness of space? Where are the opportunities to reduce the size, weight and power of space based capabilities? Defence spends around £8 billion annually on the provision of equipment and technological solutions for our Armed Forces. The cost of delivering and maintaining these platforms grows with technical complexity. For military platforms and weapons systems, there are significant technical challenges in driving down the cost of integration and ownership; integrating these systems into a networked environment; addressing a range of difficult targets; and providing the ability to defeat targets under highly constrained rules of engagement. This will drive the need for increased stand-off ranges of our platform and weapons systems which will require developments in our propulsion and airframe designs.
Training – Preparing our people for operations with appropriate training can be costly. How do we harness advances in synthetics and simulation to reduce the need for real training? What technological advances will improve our ability to train and prepare for dangerous situations without exposing our people to unnecessary risks? How do we reduce our burden on the physical environment? What is the optimum blend of real/synthetic training? How do we measure the effectiveness of team and collective training? Defence spends around £8 billion annually on the provision of equipment and technological solutions for our Armed Forces. The cost of delivering and maintaining these platforms grows with technical complexity. For military platforms and weapons systems, there are significant technical challenges in driving down the cost of integration and ownership; integrating these systems into a networked environment; addressing a range of difficult targets; and providing the ability to defeat targets under highly constrained rules of engagement. This will drive the need for increased stand-off ranges of our platform and weapons systems which will require developments in our propulsion and airframe designs.
Cost - Traditional complex military capability is designed and built to counter technologically sophisticated military adversaries. What low cost, simple solutions exist to address the future spectrum of potential adversary capabilities? How can we ensure military units and capabilities are sufficiently agile to fulfil a range of potential roles and counter the spectrum of adversaries? How do we introduce asymmetric capability to our advantage? How do we integrate new technologies into complex systems at affordable cost? Defence spends around £8 billion annually on the provision of equipment and technological solutions for our Armed Forces. The cost of delivering and maintaining these platforms grows with technical complexity. For military platforms and weapons systems, there are significant technical challenges in driving down the cost of integration and ownership; integrating these systems into a networked environment; addressing a range of difficult targets; and providing the ability to defeat targets under highly constrained rules of engagement. This will drive the need for increased stand-off ranges of our platform and weapons systems which will require developments in our propulsion and airframe designs.
Self-sustaining forces - When the UK deploys forces overseas it has to ensure that they are supported by an appropriately robust and effective logistics infrastructure that ensures the timely delivery of consumables and other materiel. MOD is interested in all aspects of technology, or alternative ways of working, that minimise the logistic infrastructure particularly that exposed to risk. Interests span technology for reducing the logistic footprint itself for example through the use of renewable or alternative energy sources, through to the use of additive manufacturing that might reduce the need for a large holding of spares in-theatre. As commercial investment introduces widely available and low cost systems, the technological lead of the UK and its allies over adversaries is likely to be further eroded, with the democratisation of technologies such as additive manufacturing, cyber and unmanned systems enabling non-government actors to strike at the UK. To counter these advances we need to explore technologies which will improve the survivability of our people and platforms, extended their endurance, and ensure robust and resilient military capabilities.

We recognise that development of net zero technologies will present challenges that businesses and society are less familiar with. We will work to make sure that health and safety legislation does not prevent safe innovation and progress. To help manage risk, we will focus our attention on the breadth of activities that net zero encompasses. This will provide evidence to inform any policy, regulatory and operational changes needed to support business. We will achieve this by working partnerships with stakeholders, communication activities, regulatory interventions and enforcement. To bring together science, policy, and regulation, we will help businesses in Great Britain establish themselves as world leaders in net zero.

Interventions to prevent health problems, developing effective routes to reach those who are most at risk or marginalised, and understanding how to effectively implement proven interventions at scale Research is needed into how best to prevent disease, ensure timely diagnosis and develop appropriate interventions to prevent acute events and chronic disease. This could significantly improve health and economic outcomes for individuals, support a healthy workforce and reduce pressure on the NHS and social care. For example, preventative interventions and early diagnosis are estimated to reduce strokes, heart attacks and dementia cases by 150,000 over 10 years, saving £2.3 for every £1 spent. In England, more than 90% of people survive bowel, breast and ovarian cancer for at least 5 years if diagnosed at the earliest stage, and Cancer Research UK estimates the cost of treating late-stage colon, rectal, lung and ovarian cancer is nearly two and a half times the amount for early-stage treatment. In England, early interventions for mental health problems can reduce hospital admissions, shorten hospital stays and require fewer high-cost intensive interventions potentially saving up to £38 million per year.
New ways of identifying those most at risk (for example, predictive analysis of GP records to identify those who would benefit from early intervention, new methods of cancer screening and new approaches to diagnosing the causes of chest pains).

understanding the barriers to recruiting and retaining staff in the NHS and social care and identifying solutions including supporting wellbeing The health and social care workforce are struggling to meet increased demand. For example, the overall vacancy rate in adult social care was 10.7% in 2021 to 2022, while NHS vacancy rates were 11.9% in September 2021 compared to the labour market average of 4.2%. Staff turnover in adult social care was 29% in 2021 to 2022 with fewer people joining the workforce each year. The Health Foundation recently identified an overall workforce supply-demand gap of around 103,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) posts across the NHS and general practice in 2021 to 2022 (around 7% of estimated FTE workforce demand) and a 1 in 4 shortfall in GP and general practice nurse posts by 2030 to 2031.

Integrating autonomous systems - Defence is interested in addressing the integration challenges of operating these new autonomous systems with legacy military capabilities. From a people perspective - what are the opportunities, costs and risks of introducing autonomous systems? How do we effectively integrate people with autonomous systems and define the boundaries and interfaces? In an increasingly connected and complex world, we need to optimise our use of rich and diverse data sets to inform decision makers in a timely manner. As the types and volumes of information available to the commander increase, this will place a greater importance on tools and techniques to collate, synthesise and visualise information in a timely and understandable way so that it can be readily acted upon. Different sources will have different degrees of assurance but combining multiple information sources greatly increases the robustness of the analysis – although we need to be able to show levels of certainty/uncertainty within the analysis.

Value: Building on the work of others, how should we understand and measure the value of statistics and data used as evidence, and what influences this? OSR’s regulatory work revolves around the Code of Practice for Statistics (the Code), where we set the standards that producers of official statistics should commit to. The Code itself rests on three pillars: trustworthiness, quality, and value. To continue increasing our capability as a regulator, we are constantly seeking to grow our understanding of what these pillars mean and how they can be supported.\n\nWhen creating the Code our perspective was informed by research, such as by the work of Onora O’Neill who has highlighted how for an organisation (or a statistic) to be trusted it must first be trustworthy. Since then, we have continued to engage with relevant research, such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) on its exploration of value and how the value of official statistics might be measured. Going forward, we intend to continue to consolidate and expand on this valuable research, drawing on knowledge both specific to the statistical system and more broadly. We want our advice, guidance, and regulatory work to be evidence-based and pragmatic, to best support statistics producers and users.
What are the range of modelling approaches and tools for forecasting resource requirements? What are the strengths and limitations of these?

Statistics representing society: How well or poorly do statistics represent society, and what are the impacts of this on how they are used and valued? To deliver against our vision of statistics that serve the public good, in OSR we describe our work under the headings of how statistics are produced, how they are used, and how they are valued. However, in practice it is natural that elements of our work and interests cut across all of these three areas. Some of the questions we are interested in span multiple areas of our mission (how statistics are produced, used and valued).
Use of statistics: Who is using official statistics, where do they find them, how are they being used, and what influences this? What do people look for in statistics or data being used as evidence to have confidence in using them, and how can we build this confidence? When a statistics producer releases a statistic or other data, it does not exist in a vacuum. People may access the statistic, try to understand its insights, use it, form judgements based on what they have learnt, and ultimately make decisions and take certain actions. Statistics are central to public debate – in the media and in policy decisions. Consequently, how a statistic is accessed and used is as important as its production for determining whether it serves the public good.\n\nOSR has already commissioned some research into how statistics are understood by the public, such as Jessica McMaster’s review on statistical literacy. However, we want to further enrich our understanding of consumption of statistics, including how statistics are used by individuals and organisations. We have greater knowledge in some areas, for example we have a programme of work on Analytical Leadership in government which (in part) seeks to uphold the integrity of analytical evidence and support robust evidence in policy development, but we are seeking a wider and more detailed picture of the role of evidence in decision-making by a range of users.\n\nA deeper understanding of the role of statistics in public debate better enables its protection and promotion. However, as a regulator we must also understand the threats to the role of statistics. Whilst we have investigated misinformation, and we intervene directly in instances of misuse, this is a fast-changing environment and additional research is always welcome.
How can we best develop the uncertainty tools and products referenced in the Uncertainty Toolkit? These will primarily be publication of the common analytical scenarios in TEMPro, the revision of TAG Unit M4 and improving future proofing decision making processes and their guidance across the department. The grow and level up the economy strategic priority is at the heart of the government’s agenda to spread opportunity across the UK. Transport has a crucial role to play, whether it be through improving connectivity across the United Kingdom and growing the economy by enhancing the transport network, on time and on budget. DfT has a number of specific interests in this space, notably our infrastructure projects, Places for Growth and our apprenticeships and skills work.
Wider evidence landscape: How are statistics valued and used in the wider evidence landscape, such as in comparison to privately produced statistics, anecdotal evidence or management information, and what influences this? What sets official statistics apart within the wider evidence landscape, how well is this understood, and how does this influence confidence in them, their use and how they are valued? To deliver against our vision of statistics that serve the public good, in OSR we describe our work under the headings of how statistics are produced, how they are used, and how they are valued. However, in practice it is natural that elements of our work and interests cut across all of these three areas. Some of the questions we are interested in span multiple areas of our mission (how statistics are produced, used and valued).
Changing world: How have evolutions in our statistical system (such as the greater focus on administrative sources for statistics) influenced how statistics are produced, used, and valued? How may advances in wider society (such as the increasing sophistication of large language models) influence how statistics are produced, used, and valued? To deliver against our vision of statistics that serve the public good, in OSR we describe our work under the headings of how statistics are produced, how they are used, and how they are valued. However, in practice it is natural that elements of our work and interests cut across all of these three areas.

Sometimes there can be a lack of certain specialised facilities or infrastructure that is a barrier to technology companies scaling up within the UK. "Technology Strategy\n\nAs the team has a broad remit, there are a range of different areas of evidence needs. These are likely to be areas of ongoing enquiry, as we seek to keep abreast of market and technological developments. We are also interested in the interaction of these issues e.g. with systems approaches. \n\n\nEvidence challenges\nOne of the main challenges we have is that SIC codes do not readily permit us to do analysis of technology sectors, so we need to use specialist datasets, bespoke studies or natural language processing to enable us to collect data on the issues.\n\nWe work with technology experts to define classifying methods.\n\nHow evidence is used\nWe already have databases on business activity and equity funding in the team, with access to other datasets across the Department on research activity, exports, skills, patents, IP, etc. We are nevertheless always interested in hearing about new data developments in this space.\n\nWe also have evidence from commissioned studies, and call for evidence responses.\n"

The future trajectory of the European Union and the wider European integration process Our remit is global and our interests correspondingly wide. The below are indicative rather than fully comprehensive questions of relevance for our work and are arranged into ten overlapping categories.\n\nThe dynamic nature of world events and diplomatic work around them mean that we often need research based insights to help anticipate, shape, manage and benefit from unfolding developments and possible futures. The synthesised expertise of researchers can help us make judgements in a policy environment where experimental trials and replicable results are often impossible or inappropriate.\n\nBecause time can be of the essence we value emerging results and insights shared via updates, short events, websites and similar, in advance of peer reviewed articles.

ARI 2: reduction of compound pressures on the NHS and social care\n\nResearch objective: Research to evaluate interventions to improve patient outcomes and reduce pressure across the health and care system through preventing avoidable admissions, innovations to make routine care more efficient and resilient, smart discharge, and through effective pandemic preparedness and new treatments to tackle a range of infectious diseases.\n\nPriority research topics: Identifying factors across the system that drive admission, delayed discharge and readmission and using this information to design more effective and targeted interventions including systems approaches such as developing, evaluating and understanding:\n- the role that all parts of the health system, from community and primary care through to hospital-based and social care, play in delivering better outcomes for people, and how the system can work effectively together to plan for and respond to compound pressures including infections with pandemic potential\n- how to implement effective interventions to prevent avoidable admissions among vulnerable people (for example, warm homes, cool spaces, vaccination, hospital at home)\n- how to implement effective preventive and treatment interventions for illnesses that cause excess burden in winter (such as influenza), during extreme heat and infections with pandemic potential\n- how to implement interventions which enable routine health services to continue during times of increased pressure (for example, modern, minimally invasive procedures, online booking systems, care at home)\n- how to implement interventions that can reduce hospital stay, promote smart discharge and reduce staff burden Compound pressures on the health and care system include additional health care needs in winter, during extreme heat events and during epidemics or pandemics. These interact with other pressures including increases in the cost of living, disease levels post-COVID and the operational pressures that the NHS and social care face. The UK’s ageing population and NHS workforce pressures mean that demand will continue to increase.\n\nOn average over 32,000 excess deaths occur every winter in England and Wales with approximately 40% of excess winter deaths attributable to cardiovascular diseases and around 33% to respiratory diseases, including respiratory syncytial virus and influenza which peak in winter. Excess heat events are projected to increase with climate change, with negative health impacts particularly for elderly and vulnerable people, while the health, social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic were huge.\n\nResearch is needed to identify those most at risk and to develop and evaluate interventions to prevent them from becoming unwell and intervening early if they do. For example, 26% of acute hospital admissions would be potentially avoidable if medical interventions were provided prior to admission (PDF, 344KB). Research is also needed on how best all parts of the health and care system can better prepare for and respond to these pressures, including pandemic preparedness. This research could improve public and patient outcomes, reduce costs to the NHS and social care, improve services and support economic growth.

ARI 3: shaping and supporting the health and social care workforce of the future\n\nResearch objective: Research to optimise a public health, NHS, social care and wider health workforce that is effectively structured, trained, deployed and supported to deliver future effective and efficient models of healthcare which meet the needs of the UK’s ageing population.\n\nPriority research topics: Developing future models of healthcare which effectively and efficiently meet the changing needs of the UK population. Developing, evaluating and understanding how to implement interventions to enable a diverse health and care workforce to deliver world-class care while addressing the current recruitment, retention and wellbeing issues such as:\n- understanding the barriers to recruiting and retaining staff in the NHS and social care and identifying solutions including supporting wellbeing\n- identifying how to structure the workforce to meet future health needs and how to drive cultural and behavioural change within organisations\n- developing and evaluating interventions to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of staff (for example, skills-mix, task-shifting and service integration)\n- developing and evaluating technology-assisted workforce solutions to reduce burden on staff while maintaining patient outcomes (for example, diagnoses assisted by artificial intelligence, robotics to support surgery and care, remote monitoring of patients including hospital at home and virtual wards) 4.3% of the UK population is expected to be aged 85 or over by 2045. As healthy life expectancy has not increased at the same rate, more years are now being spent in poor health, driving demand for health and social care services.\n\nThe health and social care workforce are struggling to meet this increased demand. For example, the overall vacancy rate in adult social care was 10.7% in 2021 to 2022, while NHS vacancy rates were 11.9% in September 2021 compared to the labour market average of 4.2%. Staff turnover in adult social care was 29% in 2021 to 2022 with fewer people joining the workforce each year. The Health Foundation recently identified an overall workforce supply-demand gap of around 103,000 full-time equivalent (FTE) posts across the NHS and general practice in 2021 to 2022 (around 7% of estimated FTE workforce demand) and a 1 in 4 shortfall in GP and general practice nurse posts by 2030 to 2031.\n\nResearch into new and more efficient models of care with a focus on prevention, combined with understanding how the health and social care workforce can be trained and supported to deliver them, are required to deliver high quality care more efficiently.
How will public attitudes be affected? Are individuals, cities or communities motivated by the drop in emission levels resulting from reduced travel? Are they more or less fearful of ambitious decision making to protect the climate? What opportunities does this present the UK Our remit is global and our interests correspondingly wide. The below are indicative rather than fully comprehensive questions of relevance for our work and are arranged into ten overlapping categories.\n\nThe dynamic nature of world events and diplomatic work around them mean that we often need research based insights to help anticipate, shape, manage and benefit from unfolding developments and possible futures. The synthesised expertise of researchers can help us make judgements in a policy environment where experimental trials and replicable results are often impossible or inappropriate.\n\nBecause time can be of the essence we value emerging results and insights shared via updates, short events, websites and similar, in advance of peer reviewed articles.

We are looking for company level data on activity in the life sciences sector and international comparators including estimates of the potential market size for AI-related services in the life sciences sector. <div>The analysis team is responsible for two datasets on life sciences activity in the UK and how it compares with other countries. One of its publications, the Bioscience and health technology sector statistics, is an official statistic and captures a detailed breakdown of where life sciences activity occurs in the UK, as well as key economic indicators such as employment and turnover. The analysis team is also responsible for publishing the Life sciences competitiveness indicators, a publication which tracks UK performance against international comparators. These two publications form the bulk of the evidence base that supports OLS policy making and key facts and figures for stakeholders. One of the ambitions of the team is to expand the range of data collected on activity in the sector to encompass a broader range of economic indicators, including Gross Value Added, R&amp;D spending, Wages, and workforce statistics, among others. <br><br>In addition to this critical evidence base, OLS is also interested in key research questions and evidence to support the development of policy for the Life Sciences Missions, a set of disease and intervention areas identified in the Life Sciences Vision as key areas of intervention to help the NHS to solve some of the biggest healthcare problems of our generation. These range from establishing a strong evidence base on incidence and its regional distribution to identifying potential innovative technologies that could address them. Additionally, the analysis team is also very interested in deepening our understanding of the economic impact and possibilities of the broad area of genomics, as well as understanding the economic impacts and societal benefits that accrue from conducting clinical trials and other forms of R&amp;D in the life sciences. <br><br>On the regulatory front, OLS would like to expand its understanding of the main regulatory barriers to the approval and roll-out of new, innovative technologies, as well as understanding the costs and benefits associated with these regulations.

A key area of research interest therefore is understanding the consequences of requiring higher levels of cybersecurity for products and digital services sold in the UK. Strengthening this evidence base will help shape and inform future policy work around the regulation of products and business requirements for cyber security. <br><br>Some technologies are critical to cyberspace. To build and sustain competitive edge in cyber-related technologies we need a coordinated, rigorous and consistent approach to identify and analyse critical areas of science and technology and prioritise national effort. CSDI is interested inbeing able to better anticipate the science and technology developments most vital to UK cyber power and in analysing thebe opportunities and risks related to those developments. <br><br>It is crucial to ensure that digital identity solutions are both secure and inclusive. The directorate seeks to gather further evidence on how best to enable more inclusive digital identity services whilst maintaining robust security measures. Digital identity solutions enable a person to prove something about themselves for the purposes of a transaction, an eligibility check or accessing services. This includes verifying a person’s age when purchasing age regulated products, when undertaking pre-employment checks or opening a bank account. The government is not mandating specific approach, but instead has committed to setting outcomes-based standards in the form of the UK digital identity &amp; attributes trust framework.

Pathways and outcomes: How do individuals within the justice system move through it, interacting with multiple (often disparate) agencies, services, interventions and policies? How we can develop, target, sequence, and measure the outcomes of, interventions and support? The overarching themes that structure this ARI are closely linked, with several questions and issues that cut across them. Some extend beyond MoJ and reflect the interests of other government departments. We want to encourage research that is tangential across multiple objectives and outcomes to develop a holistic approach to analysis that supports policy and operational decision-making. This section outlines cross-cutting themes and approaches that can be considered across our research priorities.
New technologies and techniques to aid with reducing our waste and reshaping the waste hierarchy <div> We are interested in technologies and techniques that would allow more effective application of the waste hierarchy (NDA Grand Challenge 1). This includes approaches that prevent and minimise new waste generation as well as approaches that reuse and recycle existing wastes. It also applies to the full range of our wastes and not just our radioactive wastes. </div>
New technologies and techniques that improve our understanding of the characterisation of material and waste <div> We are interested in new technologies and techniques that improve our understanding of our wastes in terms of its radiological, chemical and physical properties and its location and quantity.

We need to continue to develop the evidence base around effective teaching practice and curriculum design, with teaching increasingly viewed as an applied science (akin to medicine) where evidence-based approaches are widely utilised, and skilled teachers draw upon expert support and professional communities. We also need to build our understanding of how best to replicate the success of high performing schools, and how school trusts can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their schools, including through management of the school estate. A key part of this is building evidence on the most successful school approaches to improving attendance.

Can any of these impacts be monetised? IRIA aims to build an evidence base useful for monitoring the effectiveness of UK international research collaboration, determining the value-for-money of international R&amp;I interventions and comparing the UK with other countries.  We support a wide range of programmes as well as building an evidence base that can be used for new interventions.  This includes government plans to protect and support UK science, research, technology and innovation (SRTI) sectors, should association to Horizon Europe on fair and appropriate terms not be possible.\nWe are interested in assessing the value delivered from infrastructure which supports research and innovation, such as laboratories or institution headquarters.  An example of this is the project to relocate the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) to the University of Readings’ campus.\n\nWe are interested in establishing how UK researchers and institutions work with overseas partners and in the R&amp;I ecosystems of other countries.  The corresponding section of this document from Science, Research &amp; Innovation (section 3.9) covers how international talent is attracted to work in the UK and the impact of those researchers on the UK.  There is further interest in other aspects of this including:
How can we encourage or incentivise behavioural change among businesses, communities, and individuals to achieve positive outcomes for the environment? What models of societal change might be used to underpin these behaviour change initiatives? The research areas identified in this document rely on a wide range of research tools and approaches, spanning disciplines across the sciences and social sciences. This section is not an exhaustive list of the tools and approaches of interest to Defra. It identifies some areas of particular relevance and change, which will be important in addressing the challenges faced by Defra and represented throughout this document.\n\nSocieties demand resource from the environment and shape that environment. The social science of human-nature interactions is of fundamental importance to Defra.

What have been the impact and effectiveness of the AP Specialist Taskforces and SAFE Taskforces programmes? What are the implications for spreading and scaling the models? A sizeable minority of children and young people in England face a significant range of vulnerabilities and disadvantages. These include those already known to children’s social care, children in need, those eligible for free school meals (FSM) because of low family income, those with SEND, in particular those who have an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plans and those who attend Alternative Provision. Given the human, economic and social cost of poor performance in this area, we are seeking evidence on the best ways to improve outcomes for these children and young people, before issues become acute and require more significant intervention
How could technology and data be better utilised to identify, classify and monitor biodiversity alongside transport infrastructure? What can asset managers in the transport sector learn from other sectors in this area. The reducing environmental impacts strategic priority is in recognition that there is an environmental aspect to all transport, and therefore almost all the work of DfT. Transport is the largest emitting sector of greenhouse gases in the UK, contributing 27% of domestic emissions in 2019. Our transport system must change to deliver the government’s Net Zero ambition and DfT will drive forwards that change through our longer-term green transport agenda. On decarbonisation specifically, we published our Transport decarbonisation plan (TDP) in July 2021, which sets out the steps we will take to deliver the necessary carbon reductions across every form of transport. Sustainability will be at the heart of levelling-up. People everywhere will feel the benefits – villages, towns, cities, and countryside will be cleaner, greener, healthier and more prosperous and pleasant environments in which to live and work
Determine the socio-economic costs of plastic litter on marine wildlife, ecosystems, and maritime industries. The costs incurred from changing to other materials, including the potential benefits to be made from new industries including small medium-size enterprise. We need to protect the marine environment from pollution and improve measures to reduce impacts by better process, methods, novel technology, and communication to support marine policy.

How do we best support children, young people and their families within the social care system and prevent poor outcomes, including recruiting, retaining and training our workforce? A sizeable minority of children and young people in England face a significant range of vulnerabilities and disadvantages. These include those already known to children’s social care, children in need, those eligible for free school meals (FSM) because of low family income, those with SEND, in particular those who have an Education, Health and Care (EHC) plans and those who attend Alternative Provision. Given the human, economic and social cost of poor performance in this area, we are seeking evidence on the best ways to improve outcomes for these children and young people, before issues become acute and require more significant intervention

Which school-wide (or school trust-wide) systems, processes, and interventions improve pupil attainment and narrow disadvantage attainment gaps? Applied research might explore, for instance, how leaders use behaviour systems, pupil setting, the length of the school day, and whole-school enrichment interventions. Our goal is to create a world-class school system that ensures every child is taught a broad and ambitious knowledge-rich curriculum by highly skilled teachers, so they can achieve their potential. We need to continue to develop the evidence base around effective teaching practice and curriculum design, with teaching increasingly viewed as an applied science (akin to medicine) where evidence-based approaches are widely utilised, and skilled teachers draw upon expert support and professional communities. We also need to build our understanding of how best to replicate the success of high performing schools, and how school trusts can improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their schools, including through management of the school estate. A key part of this is building evidence on the most successful school approaches to improving attendance.

What are the impacts when statistics or data are misused, how does misinformation propagate? How can public confidence in statistics or data be maintained in the face of misuse? When a statistics producer releases a statistic or other data, it does not exist in a vacuum. People may access the statistic, try to understand its insights, use it, form judgements based on what they have learnt, and ultimately make decisions and take certain actions. Statistics are central to public debate – in the media and in policy decisions. Consequently, how a statistic is accessed and used is as important as its production for determining whether it serves the public good.\n\nOSR has already commissioned some research into how statistics are understood by the public, such as Jessica McMaster’s review on statistical literacy. However, we want to further enrich our understanding of consumption of statistics, including how statistics are used by individuals and organisations. We have greater knowledge in some areas, for example we have a programme of work on Analytical Leadership in government which (in part) seeks to uphold the integrity of analytical evidence and support robust evidence in policy development, but we are seeking a wider and more detailed picture of the role of evidence in decision-making by a range of users.\n\nA deeper understanding of the role of statistics in public debate better enables its protection and promotion. However, as a regulator we must also understand the threats to the role of statistics. Whilst we have investigated misinformation, and we intervene directly in instances of misuse, this is a fast-changing environment and additional research is always welcome.
Trustworthiness: What influences perceived trustworthiness of statistics or data being used as evidence, and how can those across the statistical system increase it? To what degree do people trust official statistics or other data used as evidence, and how much do perceptions of trustworthiness influence this? OSR’s regulatory work revolves around the Code of Practice for Statistics (the Code), where we set the standards that producers of official statistics should commit to. The Code itself rests on three pillars: trustworthiness, quality, and value. To continue increasing our capability as a regulator, we are constantly seeking to grow our understanding of what these pillars mean and how they can be supported.\n\nWhen creating the Code our perspective was informed by research, such as by the work of Onora O’Neill who has highlighted how for an organisation (or a statistic) to be trusted it must first be trustworthy. Since then, we have continued to engage with relevant research, such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) on its exploration of value and how the value of official statistics might be measured. Going forward, we intend to continue to consolidate and expand on this valuable research, drawing on knowledge both specific to the statistical system and more broadly. We want our advice, guidance, and regulatory work to be evidence-based and pragmatic, to best support statistics producers and users.
Communicating statistics: How does the communication of statistics influence their use and how they are valued? What factors ought to be considered in the communication of statistics, for example the audience, uncertainty around the estimates? To deliver against our vision of statistics that serve the public good, in OSR we describe our work under the headings of how statistics are produced, how they are used, and how they are valued. However, in practice it is natural that elements of our work and interests cut across all of these three areas. Some of the questions we are interested in span multiple areas of our mission (how statistics are produced, used and valued).
Interactions: How does the way that statistics are produced influence the value that users get from them, and how can this be addressed to maximise value? To what degree to statistics need to be directly used for them to provide value (or do people value outcomes from others using them instead)? To deliver against our vision of statistics that serve the public good, in OSR we describe our work under the headings of how statistics are produced, how they are used, and how they are valued. However, in practice it is natural that elements of our work and interests cut across all of these three areas. Some of the questions we are interested in span multiple areas of our mission (how statistics are produced, used and valued).
Statistics that serve the public good: What does it mean for statistics to serve the public good, and how might this be measured and communicated? What is unique about the way in which official statistics serve the public good compared to other sources of information? How can views from ‘the public’ be brought into this conversation, respecting that there is no single homogenous group and there will be many varied perspectives? OSR’s vision is that statistics serve the public good, and we propose that an in-depth understanding of what that means will allow us to develop our regulatory work and support the wider statistical and analytical systems. Even though we work with a range of data that is used as evidence, our statutory objective concerns official statistics and so we are interested in learning more about how they specifically serve the public good. We have delved into what the ‘statistics serving the public good’ means through several research projects; our most recent being a public dialogue in collaboration with Administrative Data Research UK, and based on this successful partnership we are optimistic about the benefits of continuing to work with others in this area.\n\nTo understand this notion of ‘statistics serving the public good’, it is necessary to understand the public these statistics are endeavouring to serve, and what they value. This is touched upon in the ARI on ‘produced’, where we explore Value in the Code, and the ARI on ‘used’ where we are interested in who is using statistics.
Quality: How does the quality of statistics and communication of this quality influence public confidence in the statistics? How should the quality of statistics be conceived, measured, and communicated to support users in selecting statistics that are most appropriate for their needs? OSR’s regulatory work revolves around the Code of Practice for Statistics (the Code), where we set the standards that producers of official statistics should commit to. The Code itself rests on three pillars: trustworthiness, quality, and value. To continue increasing our capability as a regulator, we are constantly seeking to grow our understanding of what these pillars mean and how they can be supported.\n\nWhen creating the Code our perspective was informed by research, such as by the work of Onora O’Neill who has highlighted how for an organisation (or a statistic) to be trusted it must first be trustworthy.

Transport is the largest emitting sector of greenhouse gases in the UK, contributing 27% of domestic emissions in 2019. Our transport system must change to deliver the government’s Net Zero ambition and DfT will drive forwards that change through our longer-term green transport agenda. On decarbonisation specifically, we published our Transport decarbonisation plan (TDP) in July 2021, which sets out the steps we will take to deliver the necessary carbon reductions across every form of transport. Sustainability will be at the heart of levelling-up. People everywhere will feel the benefits – villages, towns, cities, and countryside will be cleaner, greener, healthier and more prosperous and pleasant environments in which to live and work
How do we best survey and monitor underwater wrecks and waterlogged munitions (including the SS Richard Montgomery)? The grow and level up the economy strategic priority is at the heart of the government’s agenda to spread opportunity across the UK. Transport has a crucial role to play, whether it be through improving connectivity across the United Kingdom and growing the economy by enhancing the transport network, on time and on budget. DfT has a number of specific interests in this space, notably our infrastructure projects, Places for Growth and our apprenticeships and skills work.
Are younger people deferring car use or are many of them never going to become drivers, unlike older generations?  Are social norms for younger age groups changing? The improve transport for the user strategic priority is critical in ensuring the department delivers and maintains a transport system that meets the needs of the public and addresses what they care about most. It puts the needs and expectations of current and potential users (both passengers and freight customers) at the heart of the operation of the transport system and considers about end-to-end journeys, not just individual transport modes. It is focused on ensuring that our infrastructure and the services which use it meet the varied needs of businesses and the public, are attractive, affordable, sustainable, and resilient is a crucial goal for the department.

Understanding how to most effectively operationalise restorative justice approaches We have a fundamental responsibility to uphold the rule of law and to ensure that victims receive the best possible outcome. We will do this by catching offenders and by ensuring victims of crime receive both justice and the support they need from us and our partners.
Assess and provide evidence for effective interventions to reduce inactivity (undertaking under 30 minutes of exercise per week for the adult population, 16+), and increase physical activity (defined as +150 minutes per week for the adult population), considering underrepresented groups and demographics, as well as the cost benefit analysis. The Sport and Gambling directorate wants to develop and expand its existing evidence base to drive better regulation and cost-effective intervention across its sectors to achieve public health, economic and social benefits for the UK population.The Sport Team wants to rigorously assess how best to tackle inactivity and maximise the positive impacts of sport for the whole nation. As part of this, they are interested in gathering evidence on the impact of sport and sport interventions on Pride in Place in communities and the role of sport in supporting the delivery of the Levelling Up agenda. Research into this field would support the government’s agenda to tackle regional and local inequalities across the UK.The UK has recently staged some of the world’s largest global sporting events, from the London 2012 Olympic Games to the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games. Whilst evidence on the short-term value of hosting major events is readily available, there is currently limited evidence on the longer-term benefits of hosting major events. We want to generate evidence to assess both the economic and social legacy of large scale major sports events.
As the gambling reforms are introduced, we want to gather evidence as to how they are providing benefits and analyse their impacts as the sector continues to change. The Gambling team wants to broaden and strengthen its evidence base around the harmful effects of gambling and the impacts of regulation and address the barriers to gambling data access and use. Gathering evidence on the key drivers and behavioural patterns behind harmful gambling and assessing the economic and wider societal value of the sector are of key interest to the directorate. The majority of gambling is now online. Digital analytics can provide granular data to help us better understand and prevent problem gambling. At present, the government, regulators and academia have limited access to this level of data. The Gambling team wants to address this challenge and support research and regulation mainly through primary data collection from gambling users and operators and effective technical collaboration.

Disruptive technologies – New technologies such as High Performance Computing, quantum information processing and synthetic biology have the potential to radically change the nature and environment of warfare in the future. The key challenge for Defence is understanding the risks and opportunities presented by the technologies and forecasting when and where the impact on defence will occur. How should Defence proactively shape our doctrine and policy to maximise the benefits whilst minimising the threat to defence? Fifty years ago, major technological developments were primarily driven by the space race and the Cold War. Today, almost all technology development, derived from current global S&amp;T investment, is driven by the consumer market. Advanced technology development, once the realm of government laboratories, is now carried out to a large extent in the civil and commercial sectors. As technology continues to be driven by market needs, exploitation of technology to meet defence and security needs will require an increasing focus and understanding of emerging technologies and their opportunities and impacts on the future of Defence and Security. As well as increased understanding of the evolving physical and social environments in which Defence operates.

How can the UK develop measurement of carbon fluxes from different habitats and farming systems which are in different conditions and using different management approaches? This is especially relevant for peatland and coastal habitats To limit future warming requires rapid reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and achieving net zero by 2050, as required by UK legislation. Climate mitigation is led in government by the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). But Defra is responsible for efforts to reduce GHG emissions from four sectors: agriculture, waste and wastewater, land-use, and fluorinated gases (F-gases). Defra also has responsibility to promote forestry, which acts as a carbon sink. Together, the four Defra sectors represent 15% of the total net UK GHGs, with agriculture being the biggest contributor (about 10% of UK emissions).\n\nDefra has research interests in reduction of emissions, the removal of GHG from the atmosphere, and in understanding the impacts of mitigation activities on other environmental outcomes.
What is the role of the consumer in delivering net zero and how can changes be achieved equitably? What are the potential market responses to such changes and how do we avoid unintended consequences?

How can we most effectively implement nature-based solutions, such as tree planting and peatland restoration, to address climate change, support progress to net zero carbon emission, reduce biodiversity loss and prevent poverty? How can we effectively protect, manage and restore natural and modified ecosystems to help address societal challenges? Whilst also providing biodiversity benefits and human wellbeing – from abundant wildlife to green jobs to clean water?\n\nSocietal challenges include mitigating and adapting to climate change. These could be addressed by supporting ecosystem functions that deliver services such as carbon sequestration, coastal resilience, and natural flood management.
How to measure ecological connectivity and design coherent ecological networks through nature restoration? Measuring change enables us better target action to secure a healthy environment and support our rural communities and economies. It also helps us to evaluate the effectiveness of those actions. As well as meeting legislative and policy commitments to report on the state of our environment, both domestically and internationally.

How will natural habitats and systems respond to accelerating rate of change, including woodlands, soils, freshwater ecosystems, and marine systems? What will be the implications of these responses on managing the risks and impacts of climate change, and what inevitable changes will we have to accept in our ecosystems? Adaptation and resilience: Defra is the lead government department for climate adaptation, responsible for the assessment of appropriate action to protect and enhance natural and human systems in a changing climate. Also, for increasing resilience and mitigating against risk. Such assessment is used in many areas, including for the statutory requirement of the Climate Change Act to produce a 5-yearly, “Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) and National Adaptation Programme (NAP)”.\n\nAlthough Defra has overarching responsibility for producing the CCRA and is responsible for managing several climate risks (such as impact on the natural environment), a number of climate risks (such as the impact on transport, health, business) are the responsibility of other government departments (for example Department for Transport (DfT), Department for Health (DfH), Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG).

How can we design and embed robust, cross-cutting indicators of, and improve our understanding of, human, animal, plant, and environmental health in systems under pressure from climate change? Human and animal health are closely entwined, often via the environment in which they interact. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided a forceful demonstration of this interaction. Human and animal health is also strongly influenced by the “health” of the environment. These interactions, considered as a system, define the research field, “One Health”.
How can local governance best be coordinated with national? The research areas identified in this document rely on a wide range of research tools and approaches, spanning disciplines across the sciences and social sciences. This section is not an exhaustive list of the tools and approaches of interest to Defra. It identifies some areas of particular relevance and change, which will be important in addressing the challenges faced by Defra and represented throughout this document.\n\nSocieties demand resource from the environment and shape that environment. The social science of human-nature interactions is of fundamental importance to Defra.
Development of systems approaches that can be used to inform policymaking. This includes approaches to provide insights into complex systems, identify points of intervention, account for multiple perspectives, and frame policy decisions Defra’s areas of responsibility cover a wide range of interacting natural and human systems. Changes that affect one outcome are often likely to have knock-on implications for others. Policy in areas such as land management, biodiversity conservation, pollution prevention, food security, fisheries, and waste management, need to be designed in the absence of perfect knowledge of how human and natural processes interact. It can be particularly difficult to attribute cause and effect in such complex systems where evidence is often partial and fragmented.\n\nConsideration of the issues that Defra deals with as parts of systems, i.e. in terms of relationships between the parts can help us to unpick complex or seemingly chaotic situations, and better deliver robust positive outcomes for society. To facilitate more effective decision making, a range of approaches and specialties need to be applied to the above challenges.
Consistent and long-term environmental monitoring: Time-series increase in value for ecology and policy making as they grow in length. Decades of data are required to answer emerging questions around, for example, climate change impacts on biodiversity and the efficacy of management measures Geospatial data: Effective use of modern data architecture and analysis to make full use of data collected in the Defra Group and other relevant sources (for example from satellites, climate observations/models, and from other government departments).

How should government maintain trust and accountability in using AI and machine learning? What is the public appetite for government making use of these in decision making? Our aim is to support government and other public sector organisations in finding and exploiting emerging technologies and other innovative solutions to operational service and policy delivery challenges.
Under what conditions have multilateral institutions had most effect, for example on the success of international sanctions, and what lessons can we learn? Domestic, overseas and online threats are increasingly integrated as adversaries develop capabilities and exploit vulnerabilities across borders and between the cyber and physical worlds. Challenges driving security priorities include the erosion of the rules-based international order, making it harder to build consensus and tackle global threats. We are seeking actionable research to inform our future choices and policy direction in the role of mult-lateral institutions in maintaining the security of the UK
What are the causes, consequences and costs associated with parental conflict and family breakdown? What is effective in avoiding or mitigating parental conflict and for whom? How do parental characteristics including worklessness, low skills, lack of stable housing, ethnicity, parents in the perinatal stage, LGBTQ+, being (or having been) a member of the armed forces, mental health and parents with SEND children interact with conflict and influence what works? This encompasses priorities around:\n- promoting financial resilience and reducing poverty, including by harnessing the full set of levers available through the Department and its public bodies, other government departments and Local and Combined Authorities\n- supporting people to help meet the cost of living and work across government to support the formulation and delivery of effective housing policies, particularly with the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC)\n- delivering financial security for low-income working adults, and for children in low-income households
What is the best way(s) to solve the issue of electric vehicle charging for those without off-street provision? The reducing environmental impacts strategic priority is in recognition that there is an environmental aspect to all transport, and therefore almost all the work of DfT. Transport is the largest emitting sector of greenhouse gases in the UK, contributing 27% of domestic emissions in 2019. Our transport system must change to deliver the government’s Net Zero ambition and DfT will drive forwards that change through our longer-term green transport agenda. On decarbonisation specifically, we published our Transport decarbonisation plan (TDP) in July 2021, which sets out the steps we will take to deliver the necessary carbon reductions across every form of transport. Sustainability will be at the heart of levelling-up. People everywhere will feel the benefits – villages, towns, cities, and countryside will be cleaner, greener, healthier and more prosperous and pleasant environments in which to live and work

How can the operational safety performance of a maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) or its elements be confirmed? The grow and level up the economy strategic priority is at the heart of the government’s agenda to spread opportunity across the UK. Transport has a crucial role to play, whether it be through improving connectivity across the United Kingdom and growing the economy by enhancing the transport network, on time and on budget. DfT has a number of specific interests in this space, notably our infrastructure projects, Places for Growth and our apprenticeships and skills work.
What are the social and cultural impacts of digital engagement and how do they differ from or compliment physical engagement? New digital development has changed a lot of aspects of delivery for AHT sectors and research to help better understand these impacts is still needed.
What is the impact and risk of novel and non-traditional foods, additives, and processes on the food system, including on consumer confidence?  At the heart of our role is the need to ensure food is safe and what it says it is, and in doing so protect consumers from risks within the food system and ensure high food standards. Core to this is a risk analysis process which relies on independent, science-led risk assessment and socio-economic analytical evidence, to support effective risk management decisions. To assure food safety and standards, we must also recognise that the UK is part of an international food supply chain, where we only produce around 50% of all the food we eat in the UK. Our exit from the EU and push for wider international trade has further highlighted how we need to understand the role of trade and international differences in production systems and food standards.

What approaches will best empower rural communities to develop social, economic, and environmental interventions appropriate to their own local circumstances? To achieve resilience to climate change, halt biodiversity loss, sustainably manage land and support rural communities and economies, we need informed and targeted policy development, interventions, and enforcement. These must engage appropriate actors (individuals, communities, businesses, and government) and be at the right scale and place. We also need to evaluate the impacts of our interventions.
How do we improve our modelling of water resource availability for people and the environment? Clean and plentiful water underpins human activity and supports natural ecosystems.

What are the impacts of greenhouse gas removals and negative emission technologies on climate and the environment? What are the trade-offs of negative emissions techniques and other interventions? To limit future warming requires rapid reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and achieving net zero by 2050, as required by UK legislation. Climate mitigation is led in government by the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). But Defra is responsible for efforts to reduce GHG emissions from four sectors: agriculture, waste and wastewater, land-use, and fluorinated gases (F-gases). Defra also has responsibility to promote forestry, which acts as a carbon sink. Together, the four Defra sectors represent 15% of the total net UK GHGs, with agriculture being the biggest contributor (about 10% of UK emissions).\n\nDefra has research interests in reduction of emissions, the removal of GHG from the atmosphere, and in understanding the impacts of mitigation activities on other environmental outcomes.
How do we ensure UK continues to be recognised as the global leader in maritime safety? What is the safety culture in the industry as it stands? Increasing our global impact recognises the UK’s opportunities in the world and the importance of DfT contributing effectively toward the government’s vision of a global Britain. Operating and engaging globally will play a vital role in assisting the department in maintaining and extending its influence with international partners, including ensuring high standards of transport safety, security, and environmental protection and boosting UK trade, exports, and inward investment. UK science and innovation has the potential to develop transport-related exports and inward investment, thereby helping grow and level up the economy. Our R&amp;D around climate change mitigation and adaptation can help influence the international community to take progressively stronger action.
How does access to off-street parking vary by local areas? What proportions of households regularly park their vehicle off-street, in front of their house, on their street and how does it vary by local authorities? The reducing environmental impacts strategic priority is in recognition that there is an environmental aspect to all transport, and therefore almost all the work of DfT. Transport is the largest emitting sector of greenhouse gases in the UK, contributing 27% of domestic emissions in 2019. Our transport system must change to deliver the government’s Net Zero ambition and DfT will drive forwards that change through our longer-term green transport agenda. On decarbonisation specifically, we published our Transport decarbonisation plan (TDP) in July 2021, which sets out the steps we will take to deliver the necessary carbon reductions across every form of transport. Sustainability will be at the heart of levelling-up. People everywhere will feel the benefits – villages, towns, cities, and countryside will be cleaner, greener, healthier and more prosperous and pleasant environments in which to live and work
How do consumers view and understand the food system, and balance their choices against multiple competing factors (including safety and standards, nutrition and health, choice, availability, affordability, sustainability, and welfare)? The FSA’s mission is focused on protecting consumers and acting in the consumer’s interest. It is therefore essential to understand what influences and drives behaviours across the food system. To act in the consumer interest within food policy and the food system, we must understand and monitor behaviours, changing attitudes and consumer-driven trends, and play our part in supporting safe, healthy, sustainable diet choices for all. To implement effective policies, we need to understand what consumers think, feel, and do, and how these are changing, as well the differences between consumers, and how these impact on food security, food safety and public health. Understanding the role of new and emerging markets and business models, and through these, the role food businesses play in driving behaviour and influencing consumer demand, is essential. This includes the development and introduction of novel foods (such as alternative protein sources or genetically engineered foods).

What is the range of productivity performance across public services in the UK? What are the characteristics of highest productivity public services and what needs to happen to raise productivity in lower productivity services? How could existing measures of public sector productivity be further improved? Which countries have the highest productivity in their delivery of public services? What lessons can the UK learn from international best practice? The most difficult challenges faced by our public services are complex and cross-cutting. Increasing efficiency alone will not be enough to tackle these challenges, nor for public services to keep pace with the continuing pressures they face to do more with less. To that end, our areas of research interest focus on better understanding the challenges and opportunities in the delivery of public services in the future, including the demand for the public services, making more effective use of data, reducing ethnic disparities and being more diverse and inclusive, and the level of productivity in the public sector.

To what extent do these technologies enable accessible digital government? Our aim is to support government and other public sector organisations in finding and exploiting emerging technologies and other innovative solutions to operational service and policy delivery challenges.
The world is changing at an ever increasing pace. How can we exploit opportunities from new and emerging technologies in policy-making across government; and can we capture their risks and security vulnerabilities including to government? Does our current model of developing and implementing policy require work in this agile, technology driven, environment? What changes might be required? The challenges have become more complex, intertwined and dangerous as the world has become more uncertain and volatile. Domestic, overseas and online threats are increasingly integrated as adversaries develop capabilities and exploit vulnerabilities across borders and between the cyber and physical worlds. We are seeking research to help Government adapt to a changing security environment based on research and evidence.
What is needed to ensure that the asset base is robust enough to reduce the To apply our expert knowledge and capability to enable businesses to understand both known and unknown risk and to innovate safely as we transition to net zero.\nTo develop our understanding of the future asset base and the role key stakeholders (e.g. designers, manufacturers, operators, etc.) play in managing risk and maintaining safe operations. To work with industry to prevent major incidents around new technologies and applications that come with the government’s commitment to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 through working with others to understand changing risks and challenges to ensure regulatory framework remains fit for purpose. We recognise that development of net zero technologies will present challenges that businesses and society are less familiar with. We will work to make sure that health and safety legislation does not prevent safe innovation and progress. To help manage risk, we will focus our attention on the breadth of activities that net zero encompasses. This will provide evidence to inform any policy, regulatory and operational changes needed to support business. We will achieve this by working partnerships with stakeholders, communication activities, regulatory interventions and enforcement. To bring together science, policy, and regulation, we will help businesses in Great Britain establish themselves as world leaders in net zero.

What are the key routes for UK trade? What makes them key routes? Increasing our global impact recognises the UK’s opportunities in the world and the importance of DfT contributing effectively toward the government’s vision of a global Britain. Operating and engaging globally will play a vital role in assisting the department in maintaining and extending its influence with international partners, including ensuring high standards of transport safety, security, and environmental protection and boosting UK trade, exports, and inward investment. UK science and innovation has the potential to develop transport-related exports and inward investment, thereby helping grow and level up the economy. Our R&amp;D around climate change mitigation and adaptation can help influence the international community to take progressively stronger action.
Reducing Cognitive Load - Greater access to data, information and services will challenge the cognitive loading on personnel. How can new technology help reduce this burden through, for example, autonomous software agents? Which functions could be carried out by machine and, conversely, what decisions will still need to be taken by human operators to ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards? How do we integrate these advances into our command and control systems? In an increasingly connected and complex world, we need to optimise our use of rich and diverse data sets to inform decision makers in a timely manner. As the types and volumes of information available to the commander increase, this will place a greater importance on tools and techniques to collate, synthesise and visualise information in a timely and understandable way so that it can be readily acted upon. Different sources will have different degrees of assurance but combining multiple information sources greatly increases the robustness of the analysis – although we need to be able to show levels of certainty/uncertainty within the analysis.
What are the factors that affect electrified vehicle battery performance and degradation? What are the methods for assessing battery health? Tackle climate change and improve air quality by decarbonising transport. Transport is the largest emitting sector of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the UK, contributing 27% of domestic emissions in 2019. Our transport system must change to deliver the Government’s Net Zero ambition and DfT will drive forwards that change through our longer-term green transport agenda. Sustainability will be at the heart of levelling-up. People everywhere will feel the benefits - villages, towns, cities and countryside will be cleaner, greener, healthier and more prosperous and pleasant environments in which to live and work. \n\nKey areas of focus are:\n• Decarbonisation of road vehicles\n• Accelerating modal shift to public and active transport\n• Decarbonising how we get our goods\n• Place based solutions and environmental impacts\n• UK as a hub for green transport, technology and innovation\n• Reducing carbon in a global economy\n\nThe Transport Decarbonisation Plan (TDP) sets out the steps we will take to deliver the necessary carbon reductions across every form of transport. DfT's progress towards a decarbonised transport system has a vital role in delivering net zero across the wider economy by 2050 and science, engineering, innovation and research are essential in driving this change.
As well as modelling and understanding major land use change (for example from agriculture to forestry), how can we understand the effects of more subtle changes in land management across wide areas (for example changing tillage practice)? In the densely populated UK, competition for land between urban, rural, food, energy, recreation, environmental outcomes, industry and other uses is a fundamental issue. Our interaction with the natural environmental is often through our use of land.\n\nWe need to assess, in a changing society and climate, how best to sustainably use available land area as well as the full suite of natural environment considerations in that use.
What are appropriate adaptation actions to climate change across government, now and as change progresses, and when is it reasonable to implement these? How can we better understand the risks and opportunities around the policy drivers for adaptation (and mitigation)? How do we avoid maladaptation and ensure resilience to a range of possible futures? Adaptation and resilience: Defra is the lead government department for climate adaptation, responsible for the assessment of appropriate action to protect and enhance natural and human systems in a changing climate. Also, for increasing resilience and mitigating against risk. Such assessment is used in many areas, including for the statutory requirement of the Climate Change Act to produce a 5-yearly, “Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) and National Adaptation Programme (NAP)”.\n\nAlthough Defra has overarching responsibility for producing the CCRA and is responsible for managing several climate risks (such as impact on the natural environment), a number of climate risks (such as the impact on transport, health, business) are the responsibility of other government departments (for example Department for Transport (DfT), Department for Health (DfH), Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG).
How do we better consider and adapt to the effects of climate change at regional and local levels, to develop a better understanding of conflicting demands?

Further evidence is required for the development of decision support system comprised of mobile, modular, and autonomous sensors (e.g. gamma/alpha/beta, EO), as well as fixed assets and model input, which feed data into a nuclear data fusion engine which controls the overall system and assumes responsibilities of central operators. BEIS has committed to ending the UK’s contribution to global warming by achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Our work towards becoming a leader in green technologies and clean energy will drive economic growth, all whilst accelerating global climate action through strong international leadership.
Understanding the cost of crime in London to communities and the public sector We want to be effective, efficient and offer value for money, and to attract national and regional funding because partners know we make a difference. We also want to be recognised for our ethics, integrity, transparency and professionalism; and contribute to the sustainability of London and its communities.
Supporting partners and communities to reduce crime and vulnerability We know that safety requires action and intervention beyond the police service. We will work with partners and communities to help keep them safe, increase trust and support them in preventing crime.
Understanding effective police-led opportunities for crime prevention, with a particular focus on violent crime Violent crime is a major public concern and tackling it is our top priority. This includes terrorism, knife and gun crime, sexual offending, domestic abuse and safeguarding vulnerable people from predatory behaviour.
What does good work look like and how does it support the health and safety of the\nwork force? To further develop understanding of the current and future world of work to ensure that our regulatory approach remains suitable and sufficient, including where our regulatory interests extend beyond preventing harm to workers, e.g. covering assessment of potential adverse impacts of chemicals on the general public, consumers and the environment. To equip ourselves with new insights into the reasons why particular failures in health and safety occur. To develop the existing system of ongoing data collection, analysis, interpretation and result dissemination so that it continues to support HSE’s current priorities and prevention strategies and is flexible enough to adapt to change.

What can be learned from the deployment and scale-up of more mature industries\n(such as planning and consequence modelling) that will help us manage safety\noutcomes for the emergence of new technologies? To apply our expert knowledge and capability to enable businesses to understand both known and unknown risk and to innovate safely as we transition to net zero.\nTo develop our understanding of the future asset base and the role key stakeholders (e.g. designers, manufacturers, operators, etc.) play in managing risk and maintaining safe operations.

Using digital channels to prevent and disrupt crime more effectively We want to harness data and use advanced technologies to our advantage, rising to the challenge of a fast-moving data-driven digital age. We will make information and insight more accessible internally, and externally, to support evidence-based decisions and promote public confidence. We will strive to enhance our global reputation for excellence and expertise in policing.
Ubiquitous sensing and processing - in the future, sensors will become smaller and cheaper leading to their wide availability both in civilian applications and in defence. They will also be available to our adversaries. How they are deployed and how the information they generate is managed and used will be key. We need to understand how they will be networked and how automation could be exploited to task and manage them. In an increasingly connected and complex world, we need to optimise our use of rich and diverse data sets to inform decision makers in a timely manner. As the types and volumes of information available to the commander increase, this will place a greater importance on tools and techniques to collate, synthesise and visualise information in a timely and understandable way so that it can be readily acted upon. Different sources will have different degrees of assurance but combining multiple information sources greatly increases the robustness of the analysis – although we need to be able to show levels of certainty/uncertainty within the analysis.
Changes in the opportunity structure for crime and in the drivers of the tendency to criminal behaviour, whether social, innate or environmental. Crimes such as homicide and theft, and drugs such as heroin and cocaine have always been of public concern, and there has been a recent focus on areas such as child sexual abuse, modern slavery, new psychoactive substances, online fraud, and online indecent images of children.
Data science: Application of techniques, including AI and block chain, to unlock opportunities for improved and more efficient environmental monitoring, regulatory compliance, and land management Geospatial data: Effective use of modern data architecture and analysis to make full use of data collected in the Defra Group and other relevant sources (for example from satellites, climate observations/models, and from other government departments).
How can we best ensure that digital information remains accessible over time? For example, how can new technology assist with the migration of data between proprietary platforms at scale over an indefinite time period? Good Knowledge and Information Management is essential for good government. The challenges of the digital era are complex and diverse: mimicking a paper-based model is doomed to failure. We need to develop radically new tools and techniques to support enhanced sense-making for information exploitation in the near-term and better long-term preservation and management of historically important material for the long-term.
What are the alternative data sources, from outside government, that would help DLUHC answer any of the questions outlined in this ARI document? What is the evidence that these sources can provide additional value? We are keen to hear about cutting-edge approaches the research community is using which could have applications to our work. Particularly in ground-breaking evaluations, with robust focus on impact and value for money, what works and using more innovative techniques and data sharing
Human engagement - For future operations, are there alternatives to the use of hard/physical power? How can we best predict behaviour in response to our actions? How do we best engage with diverse communities, particularly where our adversaries may be hiding within the civilian populations? How do we work effectively with our Allies? Fifty years ago, major technological developments were primarily driven by the space race and the Cold War. Today, almost all technology development, derived from current global S&amp;T investment, is driven by the consumer market. Advanced technology development, once the realm of government laboratories, is now carried out to a large extent in the civil and commercial sectors. As technology continues to be driven by market needs, exploitation of technology to meet defence and security needs will require an increasing focus and understanding of emerging technologies and their opportunities and impacts on the future of Defence and Security. As well as increased understanding of the evolving physical and social environments in which Defence operates.
How can policing utilise smart assistants, such as to manage the logistics of police deployment and tasking or to ensure that victims and witnesses receive the best possible support? "The ability to pass information quickly, accurately, and securely, and the ability to intercept or disrupt communications of others.\n\nOur interests here relate to how policing can better service the public and victims to that they have easy and timely access to information. This might consider the use of possible ‘self-service’ options or smart assistants to provide assurance to victims on their case progress. This interest is not about reducing the person contact the pubic have with the police workforce but being able to use that contact in a smarter, more effective way. "
How should enriched data produced from the fusion/linkage of multiple data sources be presented to users to enable rapid and effective decision making? "The ability to pass information quickly, accurately, and securely, and the ability to intercept or disrupt communications of others.\n\nThe scale and complexity of police information means that fast, reliable, and flexible fusion and linkage across datasets is not a straightforward process. We are interested in all methods, but they must be usable within the character of our working environment, in terms of varying data protection impact assessments, data quality, and the proportionate need for access. Methods that retain the anonymity of identifiers are of particular interest as they can enable us to better work with our partner agencies."
What methods can policing use to enable data fusion or linkage across datasets to enrich the evidence intelligence picture across both structured and unstructured sources? "The ability to pass information quickly, accurately, and securely, and the ability to intercept or disrupt communications of others.\n\nThe scale and complexity of police information means that fast, reliable, and flexible fusion and linkage across datasets is not a straightforward process.

Methods that retain the anonymity of identifiers are of particular interest as they can enable us to better work with our partner agencies."
How can policing measure and demonstrate the level of accuracy in predictive algorithms? "Analytics is the ability to synthesise information to draw insights that can lead to actionable decisions, often in combination with other information and at scale.\n\nWe recognise that policing’s increasing use of analytics, including in areas such as risk assessment, come with an obligation to ensure the public understand what we are doing and consent to it. To achieve this requires deriving better answers to a set of questions that afford the public transparency and voice. We identify this as a separate ARI because it is central to our overarching ambition to build public confidence and because we believe research is needed to develop best practice."
What emerging technologies, such as wearables, can help identify and enable earlier interventions for struggling workforce members before they reach crisis point, for example, through the analysis of psychophysiological data? "Personal safety is the ability to protect policing’s workforce and members of the public.\n\nWe believe science and technology is central to policing’s efforts to identify and address wellbeing concerns, including by mitigating trauma in the first place. We wish to take advantage of emerging technologies that can help identify people who may be struggling, enabling earlier interventions. We recognise that the success of these innovations is dependent on workforce acceptance and engagement, and we seek to learn what innovations staff would use and find supportive. We are also interested in technologies that can mitigate the trauma our staff experience by the nature of their work. "
How can policing improve our workforce vetting processes to mitigate organisational risk? "Crime prevention is the ability to understand and respond to drivers and inhibitors of crime, including crowd management, public trust, mental health and wellbeing.\n\nRisk mitigation describes the development of evidence-based risk and threat management frameworks that enable best use of policing resource and the effective prevention of crime. Interventions may range from macro-policy changes to location and time-specific measures, such as making property more difficult to steal, reducing the market for stolen goods, or changing incentive structures (behavioural ‘nudge’). Our interest extends beyond crime to also cover internal organisational risk."

What are the value and limits of emerging AI technologies such as ChatGPT in policing? "Analytics is the ability to synthesise information to draw insights that can lead to actionable decisions, often in combination with other information and at scale.\n\nWe are particularly interested in analytic techniques that relieve the police workforce of administrative tasks and/or support their compliance with analytic or data governance standards (e.g. the National Police Chiefs’ Council’s Covenant for Using Artificial Intelligence in Policing). Our interests include developing mature capabilities such as automatic redaction and selective extraction from phones, to creating new support processes in areas such as Out of Court Disclosures, personnel vetting, and document summarisation. We retain a broad interest here because we seek to learn the value and limits of emerging technologies, such as ChatGPT, as well as continuing to exploit Advanced Data Analytics across the range of processes and questions relevant to policing."

What technical and behavioural methods that can be used to improve the quality of data within police systems, including to reduce the burden on users and correct inputs by staff to reduce human error? "Analytics is the ability to synthesise information to draw insights that can lead to actionable decisions, often in combination with other information and at scale.\n\nThe value of analytics to policing rests on the quality of the data on which it can draw. We are therefore interested in technical and behavioural methods that can be used to improve the quality of data within police systems. Our core interests relate to reducing the burden on users, correcting inputs, measuring data quality, and enriching data from other sources where it is legal and proportionate to do so. There are near-term opportunities through Robotic Process Automation, but we are equally interested in novel solutions and system changes that advance how we create, store, and utilise our diverse data sources."
How can the use of low orbit satellites augment existing sensing capabilities in policing? "Surveillance and sensing is the ability to lawfully monitor and collect data from people, activity, movements, behaviours, objects and data overtly and covertly.\n\nWe are interested in how policing can make use of, and respond to, the rapid developments in sensor technologies and the increasingly diverse data emerging from our digital lives. We seek to both understand new opportunities for evidence and intelligence gathering, as well as the new crime possibilities these developments create so that we can respond. The examples of interest include ‘lab in a box’ technologies, use of novel data sources such as advertising technology, the use of novel millimetric wave sensing to identify hidden objects, and the use of low orbit satellite to augment existing sensing capabilities. We are particularly interested in resilient sensing in congested environments."

What is the best practice for conducting suspect interviews in the case of RASSO (Rape and Serious Sexual Offences) and VAWG (Violence Against Women and Girls) investigations? "Surveillance and sensing is the ability to lawfully monitor and collect data from people, activity, movements, behaviours, objects and data overtly and covertly.\n\nWe wish to develop practices that support vulnerable witnesses, victims, and suspects at interview. We seek best practices in conducting:\n1. Pre-interview assessments, to identify vulnerability or intimidation (within the meaning of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act, 1999), to determine which ‘special measures’ are appropriate, and to establish how best to communicate;\n2. Voluntary Attender Interviews with suspects using secure digital recording devices, including understanding the impact this approach has on interview quality, the outcome of the investigation, and jury decision making;\n3. Investigative interviews with vulnerable suspects, establishing the extent current national police interview models are fit for purpose when conducting interviews with vulnerable suspects, such as those who have Autism Spectrum Disorder, Personality Disorder or mental health conditions; and,\n4. A suspect centric approach in RASSO (Rape and Serious Sexual Offences) /VAWG (Violence Against Women and Girls) investigations to determine how to structure suspect interviews if a suspect’s previous behaviour has an impact on ‘consent’ (s74-76 SOA 2003)."

How can policing improve the process and workflow surrounding digital forensics, including democratising the ability to run safe, rapid and effective forensics at a crime scene? "Identification and tracing is the ability to trace, attribute, and confirm the identity of a person, location or activity to evidential levels, such as tracing missing persons.\n\nThe ability to manage the variety and quantity of digital forensic material recovered during investigations, in a manner that maintains privacy and minimises the intrusion for victims, is an urgent priority for policing. Our interests span multiple disciplines since we seek not only best-in-class digital tooling for the analysis of text, media, and metadata, but also improvements in process, workflow, and our ability to ensure digital forensic awareness across the workforce. This includes ‘democratising’ the ability to run safe, rapid, and effective forensics at scene, be it through ‘lab in a box’ technologies or by other means. We are particularly interested in advances that can support crypto-currency investigations."
What risks to personal privacy are emerging from the increasing ability to identify data characteristics unique to a person? "Identification and tracing is the ability to trace, attribute, and confirm the identity of a person, location or activity to evidential levels, such as tracing missing persons.\n\nEmerging biometrics can be used to ascertain or impersonate a person’s identity. Advances in analysing microbiomes (the combination of microbes unique to individuals) and genetics could lead to new ways to identify and track criminals from traces left behind. Similarly, as computational power increases, so the ability to measure and identify data characteristics unique to a person increase. This puts at risk people’s right to privacy while, simultaneously, providing new ways to demonstrate beyond reasonable doubt a person’s location, supporting existing forensic approaches. We are keen to understand what potential criminal and investigative opportunity is emerging and what the limits are of biometrics."

What counter technologies may be used to trick large scale audio-visual data processing and analysis systems used by the police and how can they be mitigated? "Identification and tracing is the ability to trace, attribute, and confirm the identity of a person, location or activity to evidential levels, such as tracing missing persons.\n\nPolicing seek a step-change in our ability to process and fuse audio-visual materials, from CCTV, ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition), video, smart doorbells, smartphones, and social media, as well as materials from developing platforms such as virtual reality, online gaming, and the metaverse. Challenges include collection, processing, and storage (of usually large files), identifying manipulation or spoofing, working with still compared to moving images, and maintaining the evidential chain. Unsurprisingly, utmost in our interest here is the detection and mitigation of deepfake imagery and video. "
What are more carbon-efficient practices that the police should look to adopt when responding to incidents? "Mobility is the ability to move to/from locations quickly to prevent, detect or respond, including to access difficult locations safely to maximise intelligence and minimise risk.\n\nTo work effectively, policing needs a vehicle fleet capable of delivering performance and performance-weight differentials that exceed those required in the commercial market (e.g., emergency vehicles carry heavy tactical equipment). We are therefore keen to see novel developments of sustainable fleet alternatives as part of a wider effort to meet our Net Zero target. We are also prioritising research and design-focused interventions that allow us to identify different ways of responding to incidents. That is, we see moving to a carbon neutral service will require a combination of new technologies and new ‘carbon efficient’ practices."
What cybersecurity threats exist for the use of drones in policing and how can they be mitigated? "Mobility is the ability to move to/from locations quickly to prevent, detect or respond, including to access difficult locations safely to maximise intelligence and minimise risk.\n\nAutonomous vehicles, and particularly a combination of drones and fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles, offer a faster, safer, cheaper, and more sustainable means of frontline deployment and advanced evidence capture. The National Police Air Service and the National Police Chiefs' Council’s National Lead for Drones have a joint strategy that sets out in detail the technical challenges we must overcome to be able to operate a suite of complementary response options. These relate to concerns over line-of-sight flying, safety, cybersecurity, costs of replacement and maintenance, expertise required to use, and poor battery life. Each of these need to be addressed alongside extensive consultation to ensure policing’s use is understood by the public, considered proportionate, and supported."

How can candidate technologies for lawful knife detection and vehicle interdiction achieve usable size, weight, and power configurations? "Personal safety is the ability to protect policing’s workforce and members of the public.\n\nWe seek novel solutions that allow police officers to make safe and proportionate lawful interference in two areas:\n\n1.\tVehicle interdiction, particularly as it relates to stopping e-scooter and e-bike crime; and, \n2.\tStand-off knife detection, enabling swift resolution for police officers in a safe manner. \n\nWe have seen great progress against both challenges, but there remain questions over how to achieve usable size, weight, and power configurations, and the pros and cons of different candidate technologies for different scenarios. As in many areas, development here will combine advances in sensors, power, and computation."

How can sensors and other advanced technologies in next generation police uniforms be powered efficiently in the field? "Personal safety is the ability to protect policing’s workforce and members of the public.\n\nCombining advanced materials and sensor technologies offers significant opportunities for a lightweight, multi-functional, well-fitting personal protective equipment. We wish to learn about the main candidate materials and what might be possible with connectivity and sensor functionality. For example, how could we utilise and power sensors to provide environmental and situational awareness? These developments are all of interest, though ultimately policing will need to balance cost and functionality."
What workplace wellbeing innovations would police staff be accepting of, use and find most supportive? "Personal safety is the ability to protect policing’s workforce and members of the public.\n\nWe believe science and technology is central to policing’s efforts to identify and address wellbeing concerns, including by mitigating trauma in the first place. We wish to take advantage of emerging technologies that can help identify people who may be struggling, enabling earlier interventions. We recognise that the success of these innovations is dependent on workforce acceptance and engagement, and we seek to learn what innovations staff would use and find supportive. We are also interested in technologies that can mitigate the trauma our staff experience by the nature of their work. "
In what areas of policing can we democratise the science and technology so that it can be used by many non-specialists? "Policing’s Areas of Research Interest (ARIs) are underpinned by three enduring challenges that are relevant to all of the question groups, which reflect our seven service lines. We are keen, therefore, that they are given prominent consideration in everything that we do.\n\n1.\tBuilding and maintaining public trust\n2.\tFuture workforce and training \n3.\tResponding to the climate crisis\n\n2. Future workforce and training:\nWe seek to increase the scientific expertise of our specialists and our wider workforce, to drive scientific thinking across the service. We need our specialists to have the latest skills and knowledge, and we need our workforce to be intelligent consumers and users of science and technology. Thus, underpinning each of our ARIs is a need to consider workforce skills and capabilities, as well as novel methods of delivery. Where possible, this is likely to involve ‘democratising’ science and technology so that it can be used by many while our specialists focus on acute and complex cases."
